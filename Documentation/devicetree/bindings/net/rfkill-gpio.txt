Linux rfkill-gpio Bindings
--------------------------

This binding provides support the rfkill via an gpio interface.

Note: Only one of the gpios definitions is required. If both are set, both
will be toggled uppon rfkill invocation.

Required properties:
- compatible		Should be one of:
				"linux,rfkill-gpio"
- type			Shall be one of:
				"wlan"
				"bluetooth"
				"ultrawideband"
				"wimax"
				"wwan"
				"gps"
				"fm"
				"nfc"
			If left undefined, the 'RFKILL_TYPE_ALL' type
			shall be used.

- shutdown-gpios	Which GPIO to use for shutdown
or
- reset-gpios		Which GPIO to use for reset

Example:
       phy0-kill {
               compatible = "linux,rfkill-gpio";
               type = "wlan";
               shutdown-gpios = <&pio 2 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
       };
